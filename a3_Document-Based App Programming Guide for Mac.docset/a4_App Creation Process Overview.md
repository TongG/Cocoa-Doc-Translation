# App Creation Process Overview

It is possible to put together a document-based app without having to write much code. You have only to create a document project, compose the human interface, complete the information property list for your document types, implement a subclass of NSDocument, and add any other custom classes or behavior required by your app.

If you intend to sell your app through the Mac App Store or use iCloud storage, you also need to create an explicit App ID, create provisioning profiles, and enable the correct entitlements for your app. These procedures are explained in [App Distribution Guide.](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/IDEs/Conceptual/AppDistributionGuide/Introduction/Introduction.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40012582)
