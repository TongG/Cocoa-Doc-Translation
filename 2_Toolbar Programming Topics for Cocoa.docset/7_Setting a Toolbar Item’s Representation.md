# Validating Toolbar Items

The toolbar validates every visible image item and every invisible itemâ€™s overflow menu item.

By default toolbar items have click-through behavior, which is to say that toolbar items remain enabled and clickable when the user switches to another window or even another application. To change this behavior for a toolbar item, your validation code needs to take the larger environment into account. See Aqua Human Interface Guidelines for more information on click-through behavior.
